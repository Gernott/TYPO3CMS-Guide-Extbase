f:be.buttons.csh
================

This ViewHelper is rarely used, but very helpful nonetheless. It enables you to include hints into backend forms.

TYPO3 uses this functionality all over the backend, and it is noticeable by the small “question mark” images. Hovering
over the element reveals help text in a small tooltip, whilst clicking on the element displays the help text in a popup
window. A user configuration setting is available, to allow or disallow the popup window.

Special case
------------

There's a special case in which the “table” property doesn't need to be defined. This is the case then there are
form fields in the module, but when there is no 1:1 column in the database. For example, in the Scheduler, which
stores its information in a serialized format in a single field, or in the case of a search field, whose value isn't
sent to the database. Such fields can be assigned a csh icon through the addition of an entry in
:file:`ext_tables.php`::

   \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addLLrefForTCAdescr(
      '_MOD_FullModuleName',
      'Path to a language file'
   );


Note the reference to the fully-formed module name. This is comprised of the category (e.g. “web”), the
upper-camel-cased extension name and the upper-camel-cased module name. In the example of an extension named
“sfextbase” and a module named “extbase”, the complete name would be::

   web_SfextbaseExtbase


Here's an example of how the configuration might appear::

   \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addLLrefForTCAdescr(
      '_MOD_web_SfextbaseExtbase',
      'EXT:' . $_EXTKEY . '/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_extbase.xlf'
   );


The entry for the email address in the XLF file would be as follows:

.. code-block:: xml

    <trans-unit id="email.alttitle" xml:space="preserve">
      <source>Email</source>
    </trans-unit>
    <trans-unit id="email.description" xml:space="preserve">
      <source>Enter your email address</source>
    </trans-unit>
    <trans-unit id="email.details" xml:space="preserve">
      <source>
         I am a really long description, which gives plenty of detail about this field relating to an email address,
         as well as what you need to note and that you need to add a valid email address in this field.
      </source>
    </trans-unit>


Examples
--------

.. attention::

   There is a request to the backend user option `edit_showFieldHelp` within the source code of the csh API.
   This isn't set by default, which therefore blocks the output of the csh help text. In order to see a
   working version of this ViewHelper, you'll need to ensure that the following option is set within the
   TS config for the active user or user group:

   .. code-block:: typoscript

      setup.override.edit_showFieldHelp = text


Example: database fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the majority of TYPO3 tables, the language file key is usually the same as the column name:

.. code-block:: html

   <f:be.buttons.csh table="tt_content" field="header" />


Example: style attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: html

   <f:be.buttons.csh table="tt_content" field="header" styleAttributes="background-color: red;" />


Example: Icons for form fields without a 1:1 database structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example relates to the special case mentioned above, in which the table name may not be indicated:

.. code-block:: html

   <f:be.buttons.csh field="email" />
