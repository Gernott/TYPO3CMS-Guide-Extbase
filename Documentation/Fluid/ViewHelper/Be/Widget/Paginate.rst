f:be.widget.paginate
====================

This ViewHelper allows you to split a large amount of data into chunks across multiple pages, to define the number of
records on each page, and to define where and how the navigation between the pages should appear.

objects

    QueryResultInterface

:aspect:`Description`
    Not the result objects themselves, but the object from the Repository which contains the data needed to reproduce
