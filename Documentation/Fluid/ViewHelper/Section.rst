f:section
=========

A Section is similar to a Partial. The difference is that Partials are separate files, where Sections are defined within
the same template file.

     <td>{employee.city}</td>
   </tr>
 </f:section>

 <f:alias map="{employees: {0: {first_name: 'Stefan', city: 'Lindlar'},1: {first_name: 'Petra', city: 'Lindlar'},2: {first_name: 'Sascha', city: 'Remscheid'},3: {first_name: 'Patrick', city: 'Bonn'},4: {first_name: 'Sven', city: 'Gummersbach'},5: {first_name: 'Andrea', city: 'Wuppertal'}}}">
   <table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="2">
     <f:for each="{employees}" as="employee">
       <f:render section="TableRow" arguments="{employee: employee}"/>
     </f:for>
   </table>
 </f:alias>

As you can see, we've defined a Section to contain the content of a table row. Then we've passed the employee data to
this section on each iteration in the loop, to output the same HTML each time but containing the individual employee information.
