Array notation
==============

Allow Fluid arrays only in ViewHelper arguments
-----------------------------------------------

Fluid arrays are a subset of the JavaScript object syntax, making it hard to work with them in mixed HTML/JavaScript 
documents. For example the following JavaScript Object was parsed by Fluid::

 var uris = {
   endPoint1: '{f:uri.action(.)}',
   endPoint2: '{f:uri.action(.)}',
 };

Since TYPO3 6.1, Fluid only parses arrays which are used inside ViewHelper arguments, so that an array inside normal 
text is no longer converted. This change only breaks code in very rare cases, where one relied on the inner contents of 
the ViewHelper being an array. For example, if one used the debug ViewHelper as follows::

 <f:debug>{key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}</f:debug>

ViewHelpers which were written like this should be re-written to take the array as a ViewHelper argument::

 <f:debug value="{key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}" />
